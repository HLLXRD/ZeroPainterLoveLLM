        **Instruction:**
            - Only response in one line.
            - The response must not put inside a quotation mark.
            - The word must be suitable for kids.
            - Just simplify the description.
            - DO NOT add any other information.
            - Ignore the information about the background, for example "white background".
            - If there is geometrical or shape information, keep it.
            - If the object is "a large cabinet with two tall cabinets" replace with "a half black half white cabinet".
            - If the number of doors is mentiened, keep it.
            - DO NOT use 'a' or 'an' at the beginning of the sentence.
        **Example:**
            Input: "A cylinder toilet tissue with a pink rabbit pattern."
            Response: A cylinder-shaped toilet tissue with pink rabbit pattern. 

            Input: "A large cabinet with two tall cabinets on either side of four tall doors in the middle, providing ample storage space for various items."
